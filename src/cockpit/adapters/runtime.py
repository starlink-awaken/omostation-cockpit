"""Anti-corruption adapter for projects/runtime (L1).

Re-exports the runtime symbols used by cockpit so downstream interface changes
are absorbed here rather than scattered through L3 code.

When the runtime package (or the executor/i0/arch_health modules it needs) is
not importable — e.g. runtime is not installed, or its current tree only ships
the registry subset — every symbol degrades to None so L3 callers keep working.
Callers must guard with `sym if sym else <fallback>` (already done at all
dashboard / API call sites).
